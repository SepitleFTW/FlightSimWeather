# FlightSimWeather

This repo will contain work on me trying to implement my own small weather engine addon for Microsoft Flight Simulator x Steam edition.
It will also server as a learning platform as I will be learning how to program using C#.

Requirements
1) Microsoft Flight Simulator and its SDK(Software Dev Kit).
2) Weather API from OpenWeather.
